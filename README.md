#Anti-Clickbait: The Online Epidemic That's Eroding Our Trust in the Media.

Misleading clickbait can harm trust in online content and platforms, as users become increasingly skeptical of what they encounter online, as their time is being wasted. Many online platforms and content creators strive to avoid such practices to maintain their credibility and user trust. In some cases, misleading clickbait may also violate the terms of service or policies of online platforms, leading to penalties or removal of the content.

## Project Description

Anti-clickbait, also known as responsible and ethical content presentation, involves features and practices that aim to provide transparent and honest information to users.

## Very important
##pre-setup required before running Creating.py
1.open your command prompt and run the above commands
  * pip install nltk
  * pip install scikit-learn
2.if you are running Creating.py for first time , uncomment the above lines and run . For future running you can comment them
  # nltk.download('stopwords')
  # nltk.download('punkt')

## Meaning of files
  Creating.py - main python file which holds main algorithm
  temp.csv - training data and testing data
  naive_bayes_classifier.pkl
  and
  count_vectorizer.pkl - they are files which holds vectors
  
## Features

The key features and functionalities of our project are

1. Clear and Accurate Headlines: Headlines should accurately represent the content and not exaggerate or mislead users. They should provide a clear idea of what to expect.

2. Relevant Thumbnails: Thumbnails should be directly related to the content and not use unrelated or misleading images to generate clicks.

3. Informative Descriptions: Include informative descriptions that give users an idea of the content they will find. Avoid vague or overly sensational descriptions.

4. Quality Content: Focus on delivering high-quality content that genuinely provides value to the audience.

5. Respect User's Time: Anti-clickbait content respects the user's time by ensuring that the content is worth the click and that it delivers on the promises made in the title and description.

6. Engagement for the Right Reasons: Encourage user engagement through meaningful and valuable content rather than tricking or manipulating users into clicking or sharing.

7. No False Urgency: Avoid creating a false sense of urgency or emergency to encourage clicks. Don't use phrases like "Breaking News" if the content is not genuinely urgent.


### Not yet integrated

When we train the Ml we get around 90% accuracy and in the test cases we are getting around 80%, which will be later improved by using a much bigger database.

### Commercial Opportunities

The Anti Click-Bait should be sufficient for most (all) academic and hobby purposes, and certainly for all simulation-based purposes on a basic level.
